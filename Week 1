1. The textfile, travel_plans.txt, contains the summer travel plans for someone with some commentary. Find the total number of characters in the file and save to the variable num.


file = open("travel_plans.txt")
count = file.read()
num = len(count)

2. We have provided a file called emotion_words.txt that contains lines of words that describe emotions. Find the total number of words in the file and assign this value to the variable num_words.

file= open ("emotion_words.txt")
mhkos = file.read().split()
num_words=len(mhkos)
file.close()

3. Assign to the variable num_lines the number of lines in the file school_prompt.txt.

file= open ("school_prompt.txt")
mhkos = file.readlines()
num_lines=len(mhkos)
file.close()

4. Assign the first 30 characters of school_prompt.txt as a string to the variable beginning_chars.

file= open("school_prompt.txt")
mhkos = file.read()
beginning_chars=mhkos[0:30]

5. Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, assign the third word of every line to a list called three.

file= open("school_prompt.txt")
three = []
lines = file.readlines()
for i in lines:
    a = i.split()
    three.append(a[2])

6. Challenge: Create a list called emotions that contains the first word of every line in emotion_words.txt.

file= open("emotion_words.txt")
emotions = []
lines = file.readlines()
for i in lines:
    a = i.split()
    emotions.append(a[0])


7. Assign the first 33 characters from the textfile, travel_plans.txt to the variable first_chars.

file= open("travel_plans.txt")
mhkos = file.read()
first_chars=mhkos[0:33]


8. Using the file school_prompt.txt, if the character ‘p’ is in a word, then add the word to a list called p_words.

file= open("school_prompt.txt")
p_words=[] 
mhkos = file.read().split()
for i in mhkos:
    if 'p' in i:
      p_words.append(i)
